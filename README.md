'state.js' declares and exports the State class. Instances of this class are contained in store objects. The class contains various getters and setters for the state variables. It also contains the set method which updates the state based on an object representing a partial state. The object contains all or some of the state properties and new values for those properties. The state is updated with those new values and a result object is returned. This result object specifies whether each state property has changed or not and what the new and old values are.
